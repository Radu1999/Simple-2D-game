Open a terminal and go into the root folder of the project, which contains the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file.
Do not run CMake directly from the top-level folder (meaning, do not do this: `cmake .`). Instead, make a separate directory, as follows:

1.  `mkdir build`
2.  `cd build`
3.  Generate the project:
    -  `cmake ..`
4.  Build the project:
    -   Windows, one of the following:
        -   `cmake --build .`
        -   or just double-click the `.sln` file to open it in Visual Studio, then press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build it
    -   Linux and macOS, one of the following:
        -   `cmake --build .`
        -   or just `make`

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
